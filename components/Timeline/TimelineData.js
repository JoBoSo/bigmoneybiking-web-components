The Campground Steward said hello to me in the morning and invited me to park my car in his driveway up the road and I accepted his offer. I began my ride by heading north on the Stewart-Cassiar Highway. On the edge of Kitwanga, a coyote watched me bike by from a sideroad. A wierd man in an old rusty Subaru Forester with Rubbermaid bins strapped to the roof and a hitch tray drove by me when I was about 50kms from Kitwanaga. About half an hour later he came back my way, hammered on his breaks about 200 meters in front of me, and said, \"want a drink\" with a fast, nasally voice when I approached his car. I don't even think he could have reached town before he turned around. I got serial killer vibes from him. I turned off of the Stewart-Cassiar Highway and headed west on the Cranberry Connector at Cranberry Junction. I was riding beneath massive trees and mountains the whole way and I noticed the landscape becoming increasingly lively and coastal as I moved west. The sound of birds defined this part of the tour for me because their singing added an auditory depth to the forest. I camped at Dragon Lake Campground.",

A little further up the highway, the Nass Valley has wide open views of lava beds from a volcanic erruption that occured around 1700. I rode through the valley and toward Gingolx, the northern-most coastal community in BC. The road from New Aiyansh to Gingolx might be the most beautiful road in Canada. I saw a moose running through dense forest along the side of the road, a grizzly bear eating a bright-red porcupine carcus and lots of living porcupines and black bears with shiny coats. When I reached Gingolx, I hiked up the lookout trail and watched eagles fly above me. I turned back toward the east and camped next to a gravel pit for the night.",

We took off from our house on the edge of town in Arrow Heights, biked through town and across the bridge over the Columbia River. Begbie Falls Rec Site sits beneath Revelstoke’s iconic mountain, Mount Begbie. Our campsite attendant was from Ontario just like us and so many others living in the luscious land of stoke and pow. We rode around the trails and watched the waterfall. Clara discovered her special abilities as an all-mountain cyclist when she removed her feet from both pedals and let her tires do all the talking.",

As all good stories end, the locals tooted their horns and threw roses at us as we rolled back through town on our way home later that day. Shortly after our return, we were named Ruler and Ruless of Revelstoke. It pays to be a bicycle tourist.",

Sailors floated in to and out of the docks to replenish their liquor supplies at the convenience store. My next stop was Smelt Bay. I took a break on the beach and watched the seabirds. Then I picked some of the most flavourful blackberries I've ever tasted from the bushes at the edge of the beach before moving on. I rode past the Great Wall-De-Mark to Masons Landing. The people looked really interesting. The community had it's own style and fashion with really earthy cottages and big gardens. I sat by the purple garden behind the Cortes Natural Food Co-op, then went to the beach where I saw a bunch of pontoon boats sitting on the rocky floor of an empty tide pool to one side of the beach with cottages sitting on cliffs above them. I was so confused until I saw the ocean slowly fill it with water and bring the pontoons up with it. I headed back to the ferry to Quadra, biked by a beautiful view of sailboats in Rebecca Spit, and got on the ferry to Campbell River. I finished my day back in Courtenay.",

A flock of crows stole my bag of cashews from one of my open packs while was walking around. The ground was littered with them. I thought a woman sitting at a nearby picnic table was speaking to me, so I replied, 'What?' She kept talking but I couldn't hear her so I kept apologizing and asking her to repeat herself. Then, I noticed an old guy on a picnic bench looking at me funny and I realized she was talking on her phone. After my break, I got onto the rough logging roads that lead toward Cape Scott. I took the trail to Nahwitti Lake and camped on the sandy beach.",

They kicked-up a lot of dust, so I had to shut my eyes and put my arm over my mouth whenever they rolled by. I bumped into a man and his daughter on motorbikes who were mapping a backroads route called the North Island 1000. When I reached the Cape Scott parking lot, I got onto the Cape Scott Trail and rode to San Josef Bay. It was rewarding to see that endless view of the Pacific Ocean and feel I had made it just about as far north on the island as I could possibly go. I camped on the edge of the beach that night.",

I didn't realize that the route I had mapped out would be as rough and steep as it was. I figured the roads would be just like dirt roads in Ontario, but some of the roads on the map were inactive and overgrown. My brake pads wore down as a result of riding my loaded bike down steep, rocky roads. I saw three bears, all near Comox Lake after the sun had risen. Much was learned. My confidence as a bicycle tourist developed a lot on this trip.",

After, I rode toward the Pebble Beach trail and hiked about 4 kms through the vibrant green forest and along the colorful shore. To finish the trip off, I biked to Mount Galiano to hike to the top. But I made the choice to turn back when I was maybe 1 km from the top because I didn't want to be late for my ferry ride. Unfortunately, the ferry schedule changed and the ferry I hoped to catch was cancelled. I sat at the ferry terminal facing Mount Galiano from across the bay for two hours and ate some stir-fry from the food truck. It was dark when I reached Swartz Bay and I didn't get home until 12:30pm.",

I walked around the short loop that goes along the shore, and through the campground and Ruckle Farm. The sun was setting over the ocean as ferries floated by. There were turkeys, sheep, cows, and chickens on the farm, all singing their own songs.",

      "description": "I woke up to a sunny day. I left most of my stuff at my site and biked away for the day. I walked around the Salt Spring Island Conservancy, but there wasn't much to see. I rode to Ganges and got smoked meat for lunch from Buzzy's Luncheonette. There was a busy market by the water. It was nice to look back at it from the docks and hear the chatter and music coming out of it. I continued biking to Scott Point Road. The ocean lies behind cottages to both sides of the road, which is lined with orange arbutus trees and gardens. I tried to bike to Nose Point, too, but it's down a private road. On the pier at Fernwood Beach, I had a conversation about Galiano Island with another man who bike tours as we looked at it from across the ocean. We talked about the trouble with accessing the campground in Dionisio Point Provincial Park by road. It sounds like the road was once accessible until a developer bought the land, was denied permission to develop it by the community, and, so, he doesn't let anyone on it anymore. Southey Point at the north tip of the island had the most beautiful, rocky beach. On my way back to Ganges for dinner, I rode by the sheep on Sunset Farm. They were panting aggressively while staring at me and bahhing from across the fence. I went up to Channel Ridge Lookout to see St. Mary Lake from above, but there wasn't a very clear view. For dinner, I went to the Korean Food Truck, Oko-nomi-yaki. I rode back to Ruckle and hiked the shoreline trail at sunset.",

      "description": "I rode through the interior of the island on Pacific Marine Drive. It's a beautiful ride, especially around Lizard Lake and Fairy Lake where some of the bigger, older forests along the route are. Pacheedaht Beach was my favorite spot on the west coast. I thought the interior of the island would be the hilliest, but the roads along the coast were the most challenging.",

      "description": "I biked to the Coho Ferry in the Victoria Harbour to cross the ocean to Port Angeles in Washington. The ferry was built in 1959 and it still has a 50's esthetic. From Port Angeles, I biked west. There was a wildfire burning on the edge of town and I saw some nice views of it from the highway. Olypmic National Park seems to be fragmented. I rode a beautiful, but busy, stretch of road through The National Park. I think it might have been the only part of the ride that went through old growth forest. After about 11 miles, I was riding by state forests and tree farms. There wasn't much natural diversity or wildlife when compared to Vancouver Island. As the sun was setting, I turned south and road along the west coast to Kalaloch campground for the night.",

It's clearly a popular town to retire to. I took my second ferry of the day at Horseshoe Bay and biked into Vancouver. It was a bit smoggy and grimmy, and there was lots of traffic. There were also lots of big bridges to cross. The ride to the Tsawwassen Ferry was mostly unpleasent since it ran along full-blown highways and through industrial areas. The final stretch, however, looked very much like flat Ontario farm country. The ferry to Victoria had some wide open views of the Strait. At the end of a day like this, I feel like I've connected with and sensed so much of the world. The irony is that I silently rode right by it all. There's not much to it.",
